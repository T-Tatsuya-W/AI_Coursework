link to the 🍄 data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/

useful file: the extended one. It has not just first letters of attribute values, but them in full words => easier for us to read.
file to be used in training: agaricus-lepiota ----- the Data one

agaricus-lepiota ----- the Names one; contains credits and *some logical rules for the mushroom data sets*. Will be useful when checking if our AI is coming to right conclusions. 
Note: OR we can set those as initial guidelines if this is something we know how to do :)
