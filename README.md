useful file: the **extended** one. It has not just first letters of attribute values, but them in full words => easier for us to read.

file to be used in training: agaricus-lepiota ----- the Data one

agaricus-lepiota ----- the Names one; contains credits and **some logical rules for the mushroom data sets**. Will be useful when checking if our AI is coming to right conclusions.

*Note: OR we can set those as initial guidelines if this is something we know how to do* :)
